###### notes
- I did not include any Ruby project because I haven't used Ruby in 5 years.
But I am happy to get better at Ruby if your team uses Ruby for your projects.
- I included a Javascript project because I assume your team uses Javascript
for frontend web development and I think it is relevant skill.
